Buildout
========

Buildout is a Python-based build system for creating, assembling and deploying applications from multiple parts, some of which may be non-Python-based. It lets you create a buildout configuration and reproduce the same software later.

Buildout will be used by WinPloneInstaller on machines which cannot utilize `WSL <https://github.com/plone/WinPloneInstaller/wiki/WSL>`_, or the user opted out of WSL.

See `the latest official Buildout documentation <http://docs.buildout.org/en/latest/getting-started.html>`_.
