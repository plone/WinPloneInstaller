PyInstaller
===========

PyInstaller is a convenient program that takes a Python script as input and produces an executable with integrated dependencies as its output. When run on Windows 10 with `WinPloneInstaller.py <https://github.com/plone/WinPloneInstaller/wiki/WinPloneInstaller.py>`_ , we get /dist/WinPyInstaller.exe in our project folder. The project owes a lot to `PyInstaller.org <http:\\pyinstaller.org>`_

`build.ps1 <https://github.com/plone/WinPloneInstaller/wiki/build.ps1>`_ includes important options in the call to PyInstaller.
